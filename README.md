# useRepeatable

`useRepeatable` is a React hook that helps to make "repeater fields" simple. Given an array of a particular type of objects, it exposes simple methods to add, remove or reorder objects, while exposing the objects on a React state variable.

You can also assign a callback function for when changes happen to the array of objects.
